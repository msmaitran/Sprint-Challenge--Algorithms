#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) **O(n)**
The number of times the loop runs varies based on the value of *n*.
As the size of the input increases, the runtime or space used will grow at the same rate.

b) **O(n^2)**
Nesting two loops. Outer loop runs *n* times and innter loop runs *n* times for each iteration of the outer loop.
As the size of the input increases, the runtime or space used will grow at a faster rate.

c) **O(n)**
Recursive function that calls itself. Runs through all the data once.
